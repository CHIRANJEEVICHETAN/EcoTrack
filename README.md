## Prompt - 1
Ok now, In the reports page there is nothing displayed. I want both bar graph and pie chart of the Recycling reports to displayed. And also the current existing feature of downloading the report in PDF format. And also try to add some more features into the reports tab. 
And in the Profile tab give an option to add or delete profile photo. And also add some more features into the profile tab. And majorly the Admin dashboard is not all working nothing is being displayed in the Admin dashboard. So make sure its being displayed and add more features to the admin dashboard. So admin can manage everything including the user management and required management for this project. 

## Current Prompt
Ok everything seems good, But the only issue is with the Admin Dashboard nothing is shown on this page. Also try to improve the front end UI of signIn and signUp page make it more attractive by adding some good background image or gradient background.

# EcoTrack: E-Waste Management System

EcoTrack: E-Waste Management System is a comprehensive full-stack web application aimed at solving the global challenge of electronic waste (e-waste) management. EcoTrack is designed to track, segregate, and recycle e-waste with the help of advanced technologies such as AI and Blockchain, promoting sustainable practices for a better society. It uses ReactJS for the frontend, Firebase for backend functionalities, and ExpressJS as a fallback for specific features.

## Key Features

1. **Tracking E-Waste**: Through EcoTrack, users can access real-time tracking of materials entering the recycling chain by logging e-waste items and monitoring their stages of processing in an effort to recycle.
   
2. **AI-Based Waste Segregation**: The system employs Google's Gemini AI, making automated recommendations about the best methods for recycling. Providers can upload images of materials for AI-based categorization and purity analysis, streamlining segregation processes.
   
3. **Vendor Verification System**: Vendors undergo an elaborate vetting process, ensuring that only the most trusted and certified vendors are used. The system provides ratings for each vendor along with Blockchain-verified certifications.
   
4. **Blockchain Integration**: Every step in the life of e-waste is recorded in a secure Blockchain system, which keeps the information clear and trustworthy. This unchangeable record of all recycling activities helps build trust among users and stakeholders.
   
5. **Data Visualization and Reports**: The platform reports trends in recycling, material purity percentages, and other user contributions through insightful graphs and charts to assist users in understanding their impact.
   
6. **Support for Multilingual Users**: EcoTrack supports multiple languages for a heterogeneous user base, increasing its accessibility and promoting inclusion.
   
7. **Geolocation Integration (Optional)**: Users can find collection locations and recycling vendors within their area to facilitate easy drop-off of materials. (This feature is still in the idea stage)

## Technology Stack
